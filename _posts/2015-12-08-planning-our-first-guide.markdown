I'm very excited in writing this article.

This'll be our first application on this blog.

Her name will be "Another Yet Web Application with Ruby on Rails" or "AYWAROR".

We will use Ruby on Rails 4 as our mainly stack. The database layer will be MongoDB at your last version.

The topics we'll talk:

* 1) [Set up Ruby on Rails 4 and MongoDB in your Linux Machine]()
* 2) [Generating our application via Terminal]()
* 3) [Version control in our project: Say hi to Git and Github!]()
* 3) [Planning our database and a resume about mainly concepts]()
* 4) [Generating CRUDs with Rails 4 Console]()
* 5) [Say hello to Angular! Installing Angular.JS in our project]()
